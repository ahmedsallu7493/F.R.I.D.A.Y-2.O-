Sure, here is an example of a Python program that prints a simple pattern:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print('*' * (i+1))
```

This program will print the following pattern:

```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

The `range(5)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4, and the `for` loop iterates over this sequence. For each iteration, the program prints a string of asterisks that is `i+1` characters long.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to see a different pattern!
